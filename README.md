# EnergySaverTextAdventure
A game project for my First Year Seminar Class
## Game Description
You play as a character in a post-apocalyptic world in which energy systems all across the world have failed. Your objective is to turn on the power for villages that you find but you must complete puzzles, struggle with opponents, and fight the urge to use non-renewable power.
